ROS based startle-bot 

# Objectives

ROS is a powerful robotic simulator that allows us to customize robot models to fit your application. I have done simulation on Gazebo and RVIZ which offers physics simulation at a much higher degree of fidelity, a suite of sensors, and interfaces.

This tutorial serves as an introduction to driving and controlling startle-bot

All the following steps successfully worked with ROS-kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04.
